# An-ecosystem-simulaion-system
This is a simulation system for a simple ecosystem. The user would have to adjust the ratio of the predators and the preys to make a balance. Have fun!

# Rules
The predators would eat the preys once encountered, and the preys would reproduce if they were not eaten in a certain period.
