# An-ecosystem-simulaion-system
This is a simulation system for a simple ecosystem. The user would have to adjust the ratio of the predators and the preys to make a balance. Have fun!

# Rules
Mode 1: The predators would eat the preys once encountered, and the preys would reproduce if they were not eaten in a certain period. 

Mode 2: The user could use the 'wasd' to adjust the positions of the obstacles so that the Whisker Robot would find the treasure (represented by a 'star') first instead of the bomb (represented by a 'circle').
